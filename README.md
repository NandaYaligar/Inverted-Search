# Inverted-Search
Aim:
To design and implement an inverted index that enables efficient text searching across multiple files.

Description:
* Built an inverted search engine that maps words to the files in which they appear, improving search efficiency.
* Implemented core functionalities such as database creation, word search, update, save, and display operations.
* Used hash tables to store indexed words for fast lookup and reduced search time complexity.
* Utilized singly linked lists to maintain file information and word occurrence counts in an optimized manner.
* Designed the system to support incremental updates without rebuilding the entire database.
* Focused on efficient memory usage and pointer handling in C.

Technologies Used:
* C Programming
* Hash Tables
* Singly Linked List
* File Handling
